MeshTTY is a terminal-based (TUI) client for Meshtastic LoRa mesh radio
networks, designed to run on a Raspberry Pi or any Linux system with a
terminal.  It is built with the [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/)
framework and communicates with a Meshtastic node over USB/serial, TCP/WiFi,
or Bluetooth (BLE).

## 4. Connection Screen

The first screen shown on launch.  Choose how to connect to your radio node.

### Tabs

#### Serial / USB

- The app scans for serial ports whose USB vendor ID matches common Meshtastic
  chips and lists them in a table.
- Click a row to copy that port path into the input field, or type it manually
  (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0`, `/dev/ttyACM0`).
- Click **Connect**.

#### TCP / WiFi

- Enter the hostname or IP address of the node and the port (default 4403).
- Click **Connect**.

#### Bluetooth (BLE)

- Click **Scan for BLE Devices** to perform a 5-second scan.
- Click a row or enter a MAC address manually.
- Click **Connect**.

### Remember this device

The **Remember this device** switch (on by default) saves connection details
so the same transport and address are pre-filled on the next launch.

### Status messages

- A status line shows progress: "Connecting…", "Connected — downloading
  nodes: …", "Download complete (N nodes) — waiting for radio confirmation…",
  "Connected! (N nodes loaded)".
- A red error line shows the failure reason if a connection attempt fails.

> **Note:** On busy networks (many nodes), the app transitions to the Main
> Screen as soon as the initial radio handshake completes.  Remaining node
> records continue to arrive in the background and appear in the Nodes tab
> as they come in.

### Keyboard shortcuts (Connection Screen)

| Key    | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Ctrl+Q | Quit   |

---

## 5. Main Screen

After a successful connection the app switches to the Main Screen, which has
four tabs.

The header bar has been intentionally removed to maximise usable display area.

---

### 5.1 Messages Tab

A unified, scrollable message history for all channels and direct messages,
plus a compose bar at the bottom.

#### Message display

Messages are displayed in a fixed-80-column terminal style:

```
HH:MM prefix: message text
```

- **Incoming broadcasts** — displayed flush with the left margin, labelled
  with the channel name (e.g. `Primary`, `LongFast`).
- **Incoming direct messages** — labelled with the sender's short name.
- **Outgoing messages** — indented by two spaces.
- Lines longer than 80 characters wrap to the next line, aligned under the
  message text.

#### Compose bar

The input field is pre-filled with the last active prefix (e.g. `Primary: `).
You can type and send as-is, or edit the prefix to target a different channel
or a specific node's short name.  Format:

```
prefix: your message text
```

- If the prefix matches a configured channel name → sent as a broadcast on
  that channel.
- If the prefix matches a node short name → sent as a direct message to that
  node.
- Press **Enter** or click **Send** to transmit.

#### Scrolling

- **Up / Down arrows** scroll the message history one line at a time.
- **PageUp / PageDown** scroll a full screen at a time.
- Scrolling works regardless of whether focus is on the message area or the
  compose input.

#### History

The 200 most recent messages (across all channels and DMs) are loaded from
the local database on startup.

---

### 5.2 Channels Tab

Lists all channels configured on the connected radio.

- Click a channel name to set it as the compose prefix in the Messages tab.
  The app switches back to Messages automatically.
- The list is refreshed each time the tab is shown.

---

### 5.3 Nodes Tab

A live table of all mesh nodes known to the radio.  Updates in real time as
position, telemetry, and node-info packets are received.

| Column     | Description                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Short      | Node short name (4-character callsign).          |
| Long Name  | Node long name.                                  |
| SNR        | Last received signal-to-noise ratio (dB).        |
| Last Heard | Time of the last packet heard (HH:MM:SS, local). |
| Battery    | Reported battery level (%).                      |
| Position   | GPS coordinates (lat, lon) to 4 decimal places.  |
| HW Model   | Hardware model string.                           |

Press **Ctrl+R** to force a refresh from the radio.

Click any row to open the **Node Detail Modal**.

---

### 5.4 Node Detail Modal

Overlay shown when you click a node row.  Displays:

- Node ID, short name, long name, hardware model
- Last SNR, last heard timestamp
- Battery level
- Latitude, longitude, altitude

Fields show `—` when no value has been received.  Close with **Close**,
**Escape**, or **Q**.

---

### 5.5 Settings Tab

#### Connection section (top)

Shows the current connection state and provides a **Disconnect** button that
returns to the Connection Screen.  The status line includes the transport
description, the number of known nodes, and the local node's battery level
(when available).

#### Transport section

| Field                  | Description                                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Default transport      | Tab pre-selected on the Connection Screen.                    |
| Serial port            | Last-used serial device path.                                 |
| TCP hostname           | Last-used TCP hostname or IP.                                 |
| TCP port               | Last-used TCP port (default 4403).                            |
| BLE address            | Last-used BLE MAC address.                                    |
| Auto-connect on launch | Saved but not yet active in the connection flow.              |

#### Display section

| Field                  | Description                                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Show short node names  | Use 4-character short names as the primary identifier in the Nodes table. |
| Theme                  | UI colour theme — applied immediately on Save.                |

#### Messaging section

| Field           | Description                                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Default channel | Channel index shown in Settings reference (0–7).         |

Click **Save** to apply.  The **Theme** setting takes effect immediately;
other settings apply on the next connection.

---

### 5.6 DM Slash Commands

The slash-command bot is **disabled by default**.  Start MeshTTY with the
`--bot` flag to enable it:

```
meshtty --bot
```

When enabled, any incoming **direct message** (not a channel broadcast) whose
text begins with `/` is checked against the command list.

- Valid commands are displayed in the message history and an automatic reply
  is sent back to the sender.
- Unrecognised `/` commands are silently dropped and not displayed.
- When `--bot` is not set, DMs starting with `/` are displayed as normal
  messages and no automatic reply is sent.

#### Available commands

| Command    | Response                                                          |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/HELP`    | Lists all available commands.                                     |
| `/INFO`    | Returns the URL of the MeshTTY git repository.                    |
| `/JOKE`    | Returns the next joke from the joke file (sequential, wraps).     |
| `/GPIO`    | Returns the state of exported GPIO pins read via sysfs.           |
| `/WEATHER` | Returns a placeholder string (feature not implemented).           |
| `/NEWS`    | Returns a placeholder string.                                     |
| `/NULL`    | Returns "All is nothingness".                                     |

Commands are case-insensitive (`/joke`, `/JOKE`, and `/Joke` all work).

#### Joke file setup

`/JOKE` reads from a CSV file that is **not included in the repository**.
Place the file at:

```
meshtty/data/shortjokes.csv
```

The file must be a CSV with a `Joke` column header on the first row and one
joke per subsequent row.  A compatible file is available from
[Kaggle — Short Jokes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhinavmoudgil95/short-jokes).

If the file is absent, `/JOKE` responds with:

> No joke for you.  It's a dull day.

The file is loaded once in the background at startup.  The joke counter
position is saved to `~/.config/meshtty/joke_index` after each `/JOKE`
command and restored on the next run, so the sequence continues where it
left off.

## 9. Themes

Three built-in themes, selectable from Settings → Theme.  Applied immediately
on Save; persisted in config.

| Config value         | Label           | Appearance                                        |

| `meshtty-bw`         | Black & White   | Black background, white/grey monochrome.          |

---

## 10. Debug Logging

```
meshtty --debug
tail -f /tmp/meshtty.log
```

In normal operation the log level is controlled by `log_level` in config
(default `"WARNING"`).  Only warnings and errors are written to the log file.

### Common errors in the log

| Error                                                           | Likely cause                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `PermissionError: [Errno 13] ... '/dev/ttyUSB0'`               | User not in the `dialout` group — see section 11. |
| `serial.serialutil.SerialException: could not open port`       | Port path wrong or device not plugged in.         |
| `ConnectionRefusedError`                                        | TCP host/port wrong or node unreachable.          |
| `_waitConnected timed out but N nodes present`                 | Noisy serial stream; the transport forces connection and proceeds. |
| `waitForConfig timed out but myInfo and N nodes present`       | Radio config incomplete; channels/localConfig may be missing. |

---

## 11. Serial Port Permissions (Linux)

```
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```

Log out and back in.  Verify:

```
groups   # output should include "dialout"
```

---

## 12. Known Issues & Missing Features

This is a pre-alpha release.  The following are known to be broken or absent:

### Confirmed bugs

- **`display_prefix` missing from old database rows** — Messages stored before
  this version have an empty `display_prefix` column; they fall back to
  displaying the raw `from_id` node string.

### Not yet implemented

- **Auto-connect on launch** — The `auto_connect` config key is saved but the
  connection screen does not yet auto-connect on startup.
- **Channel switching confirmation** — Clicking a channel in the Channels tab
  switches the compose prefix but does not visually confirm which channel is
  active.
- **Message acknowledgement display** — Sent messages appear immediately in
  the history but there is no indication of whether the radio acknowledged
  delivery.
- **Persistent compose prefix** — The compose bar prefix resets to the first
  channel on each session start and on each received message.
- **BLE transport** — Largely untested.
- **Node position on map** — No map view.
- **Channel creation / management** — Read-only channel display only.
- **Firmware version / radio config display** — Not shown anywhere.
- **Notification / alert on new message** — No audio or visual alert when a
  new message arrives on a non-active tab.

---

## 13. Troubleshooting

### Slow connection or hangs during node download

The app transitions to the Main Screen as soon as the initial radio handshake
completes (`connection.established`).  On very busy networks the meshtastic
library may still time out waiting for the full radio config.  Run with
`--debug` and watch the log.  If you see:

```
_waitConnected timed out but N nodes present — forcing connected state
```

or

```
waitForConfig timed out but myInfo and N nodes present — proceeding without full config
```

the transport forced a connection after a timeout.  This is usually harmless —
node records continue arriving after the transition.  If the app appears
completely stuck, quit (Ctrl+Q) and reconnect.

### Serial device detected but connection fails

1. Run with `--debug` and check `/tmp/meshtty.log` for the full traceback.
2. Confirm permissions (section 11).
3. Try unplugging and re-plugging the USB cable.
4. Test with the meshtastic CLI: `meshtastic --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --info`

### No serial devices in the auto-scan list

The scanner filters by USB vendor ID.  Supported chips:

| Chip                | USB VID |
|---------------------|---------|
| Silicon Labs CP210x | 10C4    |
| WCH CH340 / CH341   | 1A86    |
| FTDI                | 0403    |
| Espressif USB-JTAG  | 303A    |

If your adapter uses a different chip, enter the port path manually.

### BLE scan finds no devices

- Ensure the node has BLE enabled in its firmware settings.
- Ensure the host has a working Bluetooth adapter (`hciconfig`).

### Config file ignored or reset

Verify it is valid JSON:

```
python3 -m json.tool ~/.config/meshtty/config.json
```

If `"theme"` contains an unrecognised value, the app silently resets it to
`meshtty-multicolor`.
